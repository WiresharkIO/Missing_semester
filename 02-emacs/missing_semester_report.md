# Report on first experience with Emacs:

### __Initial view__

- When I initially fired up emacs, I saw this highly minimalistic view of the good old days of SW and tools.
- I started with writing markdown file types(like-this-one(.md)) in emacs, since I found it to be very simpler to start with. However there are many other file types which Emacs adhere to such as * xml, json,org mode files, LaTex,*..
- Added a configuration file, init.el to install tools like magit, to change theme to dark mode from initial white mode, python packages,..

### __Difference of Emacs from editors__

- I experienced that I'm using a lot of key-bindings to run operations, than I did with my previous IDEs say Pycharm, VScode,..
