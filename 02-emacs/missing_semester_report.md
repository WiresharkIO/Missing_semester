__Report on first experience with Emacs__

> __Initial view__

When I initially fired up emacs, I saw this highly minimalistic view of the good old days of SW and tools.

> __Experience with emacs__
- I started with writing markdown file types(like-this-one(.md)) in emacs, since I found it to be very simpler and easy to start with. However there are many other file types which Emacs adhere to such as
  - xml
  - json
  - org mode files
  - LaTex
  - so-on,.

> __Configuration file__
- Added a configuration file, init.el to install tools like:
1. magit           - To enable Github functionalities from the editor on the flow.
2. spacemacs-theme - To change theme to dark mode from initial white mode.
3. python-mode     - To enable language functionalities(however didn't use it in this report).
4. auto-completion with company-mode.

This configuration file allows to install everything when the emacs is loaded, and the user doesn't need to check individual dependencies everytime in the minibuffer.

I feel there are tons of more emacs cpabilities which I didn't tried yet.

> __Difference of Emacs from other editors__

I experienced that I'm using a lot of key-bindings to run operations, than I did with my previous IDEs say Pycharm, VScode,..
